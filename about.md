Hi, I'm Dimitar.

I have been working fullÂ­time as a software engineer since 2007. Most of my time I spend developing complex enterprise software. Over the years I've developed a very strong passion for computers and technology. I got my first computer when I was 7 years old, and I have been writing software ever since. I enjoy dabbing into new technologies and get out of my comfort zone. This here is my blog where I share my experiences, reflect on things and document my journey into software development.
