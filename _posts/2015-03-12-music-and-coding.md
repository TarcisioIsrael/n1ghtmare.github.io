Like most programmers (I’ve met) – I like – nay – need to listen to music while I code. It helps me focus by removing “office noise”, it also gets me “in the zone” (you know the zone where you code for hours and you feel unstoppable).

I thought I’d post some of my favorite mixes:

- [Deus Ex: Human Revolution OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyG6YMLEWus) – just a freaking cool technopunk soundtrack, one of my absolute favorites

- [TRON Legacy OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYJBcr1LDg4) - Daft Punk at their best

- [Best of Gramatik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_1hS1aIC8) - not sure how to classify this, I’m leaning to hip-hop. I love it!

- [Poldoore - Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDCAaFdmIr8) - same as before, really cool stuff

- [Griz - Rebel Era](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo7bP1A4GFc) - discovered this by accident and loved every bit

Happy coding!
